# What's coming next?

## Release v3.4.10

Plan for the next release is to fix all bugs, add some more tests and improve few things... as usual :)


## Code coverage increase

We have one simple rule: _just increase code coverage by **1%**_. We are constantly increasing code coverage by writing more testcases. Even if the increase is small, it is still a _good thing_ to do.
