# What's coming next?

## Release v3.5.1

After so many exiting changes in 3.5, the next release will be all about
issues fixing and small changes.

NEW
: `ServletDispatcherResult` now supports multiple extensions: `jspf` and `jsp`.
Added `AbstractTemplateViewResult` as base template *Madvoc* result.

FIXED
: Fixed NPE in *Http* when response body is `null` and when 'Content-Length'
is missing.

## Code coverage increase

We have one simple rule: _just increase code coverage by **1%**_. We are constantly increasing code coverage by writing more testcases. Even if the increase is small, it is still a _good thing_ to do.
