# What's coming next?

## Release v3.7.1

This is the next major release in our road map.


## Code coverage increase

We have one simple rule: _just increase code coverage by **1%**_.
We are constantly increasing code coverage by writing more testcases.
Even if the increase is small, it is still a _good thing_ to do.
