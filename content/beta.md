# What's coming next?

## Release v3.6.6

Some more fixes and minor improvements.


## Code coverage increase

We have one simple rule: _just increase code coverage by **1%**_.
We are constantly increasing code coverage by writing more testcases.
Even if the increase is small, it is still a _good thing_ to do.
