# Who loves Jodd? ![heart](gfx/heart.png)

**Awesome** people loves *Jodd* :) Share your success stories with the community!

## About Jodd

> Jodd is oriented more around simpler libraries for doing what people
have oftentimes used heavyweight frameworks for
(not in terms of performance though necessarily but in terms of mental efforts
and scaffolding required to get a MVP out the door).

> Jodd in itself could work for not needing an app container by using something
like Winstone (Jenkins is built with it) for deployment models closer to systems
like node.js or Flask and Sinatra that emphasize minimal scaffolding to make
it easier to horizontally scale a system by just deploying more dumb nodes.

> I've seen Jodd used in production systems and just never seen a stacktrace
fail to that point so far. I've only ever seen application code fail in itself
or fail due to a side effect or misunderstanding of the underlying libraries.
