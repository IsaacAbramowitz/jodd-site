# HtmlStapler

*HtmlStapler* is a nice tool for automatic packaging of web resources
included by HTML page: javascript and CSS files. Just by **enabling**
*HtmlStapler* in your web application, all multiple resource (javascript
and css) links will be **automatically** and **transparently** replaced
by a **single** link(s) - without any user modification of HTML page or
using of server-side technologies.

This significantly speeds up the webpage load time and the page response
as instead of loading multiple resource files, page will load just
one/two links. In the same time, the development process would remain
the same, since resource bundle management happens in the runtime,
**transparently** from a user.

Ain't that cool? :)
