# The Importance of Being Small

Jodd is oriented more around simpler libraries for doing what people have
oftentimes used heavyweight frameworks for: not in terms of performance
though necessarily, but in terms of mental efforts and scaffolding required
to get a MVP out the door. The very point of minimalism from a reliability
perspective is to reduce points of failure in code with simply less parts.

With only 1.5 MB in size, Jodd tools and microframeworks tries to make
things as simple as possible, but no simpler.

Todays world of Java is ruled by Enterprise Giants. It seems that
nowadays we are coding more in frameworks, then with the language
itself. Did we lost the joy of simple coding? Meet Jodd microframeworks,
return to simplicity of coding in Java.
