# Simple Common Sense principle
		
*Jodd* uses common sense: it tries to make things as simple as possible, but no simpler.

Many programmers have a tendency to be _Too Smart_. Being _Smart_, they
introduce various kinds of _Magic_ into their software. This will usually
lead to a software design that is more generic, dynamic and flexible than is needed,
has more features than is needed, and is hence much more complex than is needed.
Also, generally, complex solutions will be slower than simple counterparts,
will be more prone to containing bugs, will be more difficult to debug,
more difficult to maintain, more difficult to explain,
and more difficult to learn. Which are, generally, bad things.

*Jodd* doesn't offer closed out-of-box solution that claims to magically solve all problems.
Instead, *Jodd* provides solutions remaining **open** for easy extension and accommodation.
Under the hood, everything should look natural to those familiar with Java, OOP, and, of course, common sense.
