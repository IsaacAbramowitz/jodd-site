# Build web apps with Jodd

Welcome to *Jodd*! The best way to learn something is to start playing with it.
As every beginning may be hard, here is a nice way how to start with
*Jodd* micro frameworks, in an easy-to-follow, step-by-step tutorials. In the
same time we will point out some best practices using *Jodd* micro frameworks
and tools. At the end, you will have a nice web application - or just
skeleton - that can be easily extended and further modified for your needs.

## Examples

There are several examples you can start with! Depending on how much time
do you have and if you want to dive into the code, choose
whatever you like.

### 1) Fast app development with Jodd Joy

This is probably the best place to start with *Jodd*.
This one-page tutorial gives you a working example of
simple web application and most important *Jodd* features.
You will need just 10 minutes reading or 30 minutes trying out.
Enjoy [fast app development with Joy](fast-jodd-dev-with-joy.html)!

### 2) App development in more details

If you want to learn more about various *Jodd* microframeworks
you can go and dive deeply into set of pages explaining
various topics and features. You will need more time for this (60 minutes),
but you will learn more! Enjoy
[*Jodd* development in details](jodd-dev-details.html).

### 3) Quickstart

If you have less time or you want to jump right into the code you might
consider trying: [Jodd QuickStart](http://jodd.org/doc/quickstart/index.html).
This is a collection of empty, but preconfigured projects, build with
some or all *Jodd* micro-frameworks. 

### 4) Real-world application

If you want more complex, real-world example, you might
check [Uphea](/uphea/index.html). It's an example of real web application,
so you can see all kind of different *Jodd* usages in action.
