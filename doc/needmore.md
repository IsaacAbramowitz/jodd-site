# Need more documentation?

# Just **ASK** for it.

*Jodd* is not a small library - it contains many features and utilities.
More important, *Jodd* is very open for extension, so knowing of
underlying layers is a *good thing*. Fortunately, code behind is clean
and easy to follow.

Anyhow, examples and written explanation are... *priceless*.

There are so many topics we can write about and features to describe.
Significant effort is put into making documentation constantly growing
and upgrading, trying to cover as much as possible.

Nevertheless, please do not hesitate to [ask support](/contact.html) for
(more) details about some specific topic or feature. We will write it
for you as soon as possible.

Meanwhile, take a look at the _tests_ - they are always up-to-date with the
syntax changes and may be a good starting point for your exploration.
